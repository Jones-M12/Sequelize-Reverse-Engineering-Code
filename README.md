[Repo: Notes Application](https://github.com/Jones-M12/Notes-Application-Jones)

[Deployed Site: Notes Application Jones](https://notes-application-jones.herokuapp.com/)


## Overview

This application was designed to allow a user to utilize an online notes application for writing, saving and deleting notes. 

It allows a user to move away from hand written notes that can be lost or easily damaged.

A user can better organize ideas without forgetting or being unable to recall.

## Code Overview

I have designed this project from start to finish, gaining a better understanding of the importance of file stuctures, how they are connected, and how they cna help with organization.

You will see the file it setup similiar to the structure below:

style.css
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ config--> ðŸ“‚ Folder contains configuration settings and middleware compotents that interact with the 
|   |              application to support verification metrics and route path direction.
|   |
|   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware
|   |        â””â”€â”€ isAuthenticated.js
|   |               â””â”€â”€> ## This file is used to direct the path of the user. If the use wishes to reached the 
|   |                        member page they must be logged in or else they will be restricted from doing so                     
|   |                        and wlll be directed to the login page.
|   |
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ config.json

|                   and serving webpages related to an account. It defines the paramters the user must provide in order 
|                   to have access to the apllication, email and password conditions. Moreover, it confirms
|                   the existence of a user and assists with directing the route path accordingly.

â”œâ”€â”€ models--> ðŸ“‚ Folder contains dependencies that are used to create Sequelize tables.
|   |
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
|   |       â””â”€â”€> ## provides the ability to allow all models within the models folders to be references when needed.
|   |
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ user.js
â”‚          â””â”€â”€> ## Sequelize Model that represents a table.

    â””â”€â”€> ## This is where the rest of the magic happens. Inside this file all the references to required dependencies are list. 
            It references dependencies to the config folder, models folder, everything in the public folder, and the routes folder's. This is
            where the port setup, creation to express application, middle configuration, and routes dependencies requirements all take place
            in order to sync the database together to allow the application to function.
