[Repo: Notes Application](https://github.com/Jones-M12/Notes-Application-Jones)

[Deployed Site: Notes Application Jones](https://notes-application-jones.herokuapp.com/)


## Overview

This application was designed to allow a user to utilize an online notes application for writing, saving and deleting notes. 

It allows a user to move away from hand written notes that can be lost or easily damaged.

A user can better organize ideas without forgetting or being unable to recall.

## Code Overview

I have designed this project from start to finish, gaining a better understanding of the importance of file stuctures, how they are connected, and how they cna help with organization.

You will see the file it setup similiar to the structure below:

style.css
```

├── config--> # Folder contains configuration settings and middleware compotents that interact with the 
|   |              application to support verification metrics and route path direction.
